# whackexcel
WhackExcel is a Javascript game inspired by Whack-A-Mole but for Whacking Excel Files.
It is intended to ***demonstrate in a playful way*** that *Excel Files* are not the ***present or future*** of keeping track of progress in ***process engineering***, but the past and should therefore be ***avoided*** at any cost.  
The modern solution is a utilizing a data base and operating on a UI in the browser.
